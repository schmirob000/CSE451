Question 1: Error code (only for certain exceptions)
Question 2: No. It doesn't have permission to fault that way, so there's a
protection fault. If there wasn't, this would be a vulnerability.
Question 3: If we set it up so that the user has permission to make a 
breakpoint system call, it will generate a break point exception.
If we don't, this will trigger a general protection fault, since user doesn't
have the correct permissions.
Question 4: These mechanisms prevent programs from accessing information they
shouldn't be able to access. If we page fault in softint instead we reveal
information to the user we don't want them to know.
Question 5: Backtrace is trying to look up locations using the kernel's page
table, but since libmain is in userspace, it can't find the correct mappings.
Question 6: It outputs the Fibonacci sequence up to 55.
Question 7: Yes. After running the Go program, JOS printed out that it destroyed
the environment, leading us to believe that the memory is reclaimed. Env Free iscalled which flushes all mapped pages in the userspace.
